- Use correct spelling and grammar

#### List two (2) disadvantages or problems with using concatenation to build Python strings.
- it can be very long.
- It could be difficult to find one specific thing in longer concstenated strings.


#### What's one advantage of using an f-string to build a string in Python?  (HINT: Think numeric data!)
- Numeric data is not addable to strings via concatonation. f-strings however do allow this.
