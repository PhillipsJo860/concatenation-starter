# Concatenation Practice
# Joshua & 


# Work with your assigned partner
# Each person in your team should take turns writing the code to create and display longer strings
# Check your partner's code for spelling, capitalization, and coding errors
# Correct any bugs in your code

# Part 1
# Create variables to store your first, middle, and last name
# Have Python print a message that contains your concatenated full name, i.e., your combined first, middle and last names

# first_name = 'Joshua'
# middle_name = 'James'
# last_name = 'Phillips'
# print(first_name+' '+middle_name+' '+last_name)

# Part 2
# Assume you're building a Space Invaders game
# Use concatenation to create and display a custom welcome message that includes the player's first name

# game = 'Space Invaders'
# player_name = input('enter name here: ')
# print(f'Hello {player_name} and welcome to {game}!')


# Part 3
# Use concatenation to build and display a string that includes your first name, last name, and the year you were born

# first = 'Joshua'
# last = 'Phillips'
# year = '2005'
# print(first + ' ' + last + ' ' + year)


# Part 4
# Use concatenation to create and display a sentence that says which country in the world
# you would visit if money were no object

place = 'Japan'

print('If I were to visit somplace as if money wasnt an issue I would go to ' + place + ' and would most likely not want to leave. (If it werent for the language gap.)')
